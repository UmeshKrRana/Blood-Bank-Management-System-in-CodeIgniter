# Blood-Bank-Management-System-in-CodeIgniter
The Blood Bank Management System application is based on the CodeIgniter framework. There are 2 types of users:  Hospitals and Receivers. In the first step, the hospital will have to register/login to create/signin into the account. Once the account has been created, the hospital can login into the account. There are the options to add blood info according the blood samples. The hospital can check the available blood samples and the request that has been made by the receivers. The receiver can login into own account and can make request for the blood sample from the given list.
